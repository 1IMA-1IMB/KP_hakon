         <h2>OVERVIEW & BACKROUND</h2>
            <p> "You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a 
                path paved with blood. As you venture on, you find yourself inescapably 
                drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Where do these thoughts come from?"</p>

            <p> The Dark Urge origin adds new interactions, quests and opportunities 
                 for that character, and can be played as good, evil, or anything 
                 in-between. Unlike the other Origins you can fully customize the apperance of 
                 Durge, and he's not available as a companion. If you do not play as him you
                  can find him at the bhaal temple in act 3 dead. His corpse is named "fallen bhaalspawn"</p>

             <p>Prior to their amnesia, the Dark Urge was a much more cold and calculated 
                individual than their bloodkin, Orin. They believed in killing for killing's sake, 
                preferring practical and simple methods over flair and grace, and took issue with 
                extravagant or needlessly creative killings. They were, on occasion, deeply loyal to Bhaal,
                but would nonetheless often stray from their intended purpose.]</p>

         <h2>QUEST LINE</h2>

         <p> the dark urge's questline is named "The urge"</p>
 
         <p> In Act 1, your butler Scelaritus Fel introduces himself after a 
             dramatic encounter with the bard Alfira/Quil, presenting you with the 
             enigmatic Deathstalker Mantle. However, he remains forbidden to provide 
             clarity about your identity.</p>
 
         <p> your urges continue with act 2, urging you to kill Isobel, the 
             cleric of Seluna at Last Light Inn. Resisting these urges leads to 
             alternative challenges, and giving in results in your butler rewarding 
             you with the formidable Slayer formâ€”a power reserved for the most dedicated 
             followers of Bhaal.</p>
 
         <p> In Act 3, Enver Gortash unveils a shocking revelation: 
             you were once a mastermind behind the cult of the absolute. The Dark 
             Urge was intended to be a villain in the cult until another Bhaalspawn, 
             Orin the Red, intervened. Orin drilled a hole in Durge's skull and inserted 
             a mindflayer worm, causing the memory loss. The climactic duel with Orin offers 
             the choice to resist Bhaal or embrace your destiny as his chosen, seizing control of 
             the Netherbrain.</p>

         <h2>HISTORY</h2>
         <p>EARLY LIFE</p>
         <p>The Dark Urge is a Bhaalspawn, but unlike other Bhaalspawn, they weren't born,
            they were created from the dead flesh of Bhaal himself. The Dark Urge grew up outside 
            the Cult of Bhaal, and were at some point taken in by a couple. They had a 
            relatively peaceful childhood for a time, before succumbing to the urge and murdering 
            their loved ones and foster parents</p>

        <p>THE PLAN</p>
        <p> Eventually, the Dark Urge became leader of the Cult of Bhaal, vowing to 
            bring about the extinction of all life in existence in honor of their father.
            During this time, fellow Bhaalspawn Orin the Red joined their ranks and served
            under the Dark Urge.</p>

         <p>Prompted by Bhaal's visions, the Dark Urge collaborated with Enver 
            Gortash to steal the Crown of Karsus from Mephistopheles' Vault. Their 
            goal was to create a soulless mind flayer army for mass annihilation, including
            their own demise. Despite planning betrayal, the Dark Urge allied with Gortash 
            and Ketheric Thorm, the chosen of Bane and Myrkul.</p>

        <p>THE BETRAYAL</p>
        <p>At Moonrise Towers, the Chosen raided the mind flayer colony, using the 
            Crown to control the elder brain. During the operation, the Dark Urge formed 
            an unique connection with the elder brain, aligned with their plan. Initially revered as
            a god, the Dark Urge's status changed when betrayed by their jealous sister, Orin the Red, 
            resulting in a pierced skull and infection, marking them as the first True Soul.
         </p>

         <p>Discovered by Kressa Bonedaughter, the Dark Urge's resilience intrigued her. Kressa experimented
            on the Dark Urge, rendering them speechless and inclined toward violence. 
            The Elder Brain termed the Dark Urge a "True Soul," inspiring Gortash's plan 
            for more True Souls and the false religion of "the Absolute" for Unity.
            To end Kressa's obsession, her husband sent the broken Dark Urge on a Nautiloid Ship, 
            waking with no memories.</p>
